          <h5 class="header light">Open Source Water</h5>
          Billions of people make do with unsafe water and inadequate sanitation treatment; development projects that aim to fix this frequently cost too much, achieve too little, and leave little or no public record. WASH for All is tracking the path towards universal access to water and sanitation by mapping the worldâ€™s knowledge of where these needs are unmet, who is working to meet them, and how. This page focuses on twelve drinking water treatment plants designed by AguaClara, a Cornell University engineering project team, and Agua Para el Pueblo, a Honduran NGO; all twelve of these plants are exclusively gravity-powered. The performance data of these plants is submitted by plant operators through their phones and visualized here. Data is also made available for download in the spirit of transparency and open-source.

          <h5 class="header light">AguaClara and Agua Para el Pueblo</h5>
          AguaClara is a Cornell University engineering project team dedicated to designing sustainable, gravity-powered water treatment plants. Agua Para el Pueblo, a Honduran NGO, works with local engineers to construct plants using AguaClara designs. The 12 plants built in Honduras so far under this collaboration serve approximately 50,000 people each day.
